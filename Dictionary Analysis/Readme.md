# Dictionary Analysis
To make a programming language entirely out of consonants, I thought I'd get an English word bank and find the most common three-consonant stems that appear in the English language.\
\
I used the `words_alpha.txt` file provided by [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).\
I also used the word information api offered by [datamuse](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to sort words by how common they are.
